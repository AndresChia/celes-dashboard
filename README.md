# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/AndresChia/celes-dashboard).

## Project Description

This React project allows users to visualize information about air quality, precipitation probability, and current weather conditions in their current location. Data is fetched from a weather API and presented in easy-to-understand graphs and panels.

### Features

- Displays the current Air Quality Index (AQI) on a line graph.
- Indicates the probability of precipitation in the next hours as a percentage and bar graph.
- Shows the current temperature, feels like, humidity, and weather description in an informative panel.
- Utilizes geolocation to determine the user's location and obtain accurate weather data.
- User-friendly and responsive user interface that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Weather API (open weather map)
- Charting libraries (Recharts)
- Geolocation

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
